io.spring.dependency-management version 1.0.15.RELEASE: This plugin provides Maven-like dependency management for Gradle builds.

java: This plugin adds support for building Java projects.

checkstyle: This plugin adds support for enforcing code style rules.

jacoco: This plugin adds support for code coverage reports.

org.sonarqube version 3.3: This plugin adds support for analyzing code with SonarQube.

Dependencies
The following dependencies are included in this build file:

org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter: This dependency includes core Spring Boot libraries and configurations.

org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test: This dependency includes libraries for testing Spring Boot applications.

org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web: This dependency includes libraries for building web applications with Spring Boot.

Lint Stage
The checkstyle configuration in this build file specifies the version of Checkstyle to use, the location of the configuration file, and whether to show violations and fail the build if any are found.

Test Stage
The test configuration in this build file specifies the use of JUnit 5 for testing.

SonarQube Stage
The sonarqube configuration in this build file specifies the properties for analyzing code with SonarQube, including the project name, project key, organization, and host URL.

Docker Pull Stage
The pullDockerImage task in this build file specifies a command to pull a Docker image for a Spring Boot application.

***

azure-pipelines.yml
This repository contains an Azure Pipelines configuration file (azure-pipelines.yml) for building and deploying a Spring Boot application with Gradle, Docker, and SonarQube.

Configuration Overview
The pipeline has four stages:

LintBuildDocker: This stage runs Checkstyle to lint the code and then builds a Docker image of the application.
UnitTestandDockerBuildPush: This stage runs unit tests and then builds and pushes the Docker image to a Docker registry.
Docker_Pull: This stage pulls a Docker image from the Docker registry.
SonarQube_Stage: This stage runs SonarQube analysis on the code and generates a report.

Pipeline Configuration Details

Trigger
The pipeline is triggered on the dev branch.

Variables
The pipeline defines the following variables:

SONAR_PROJECT_NAME: The name of the project in SonarQube.
SONAR_PROJECT_KEY: The project key in SonarQube.
SONAR_ORGANIZATION: The name of the organization in SonarQube.
SONAR_HOST_URL: The URL of the SonarQube server.

Stages

LintBuildDocker
This stage has one job called Lint. The job runs Checkstyle to lint the code and then builds a Docker image of the application.

UnitTestandDockerBuildPush
This stage has one job called UnitTest. The job runs unit tests and then builds and pushes the Docker image to a Docker registry.

Docker_Pull
This stage has one job called Pull. The job pulls a Docker image from the Docker registry.
